# My XMonad and Hyprland configuration
My dotfiles for my XMonad & Hyprland. This repo is mostly meant for me to store my configs for easy access but feel free to yoink them. 
I try to keep my files easily readable and editable. I recently switched over to hyprland, it's a great window manager. My configs for both window managers are very similar. I only use hyprland nowadays, but my old configs for xmonad will still be available here.

### Prerequisites: 
Xmonad, xmonad-contrib and xmobar from the Arch repos are old and the git versions from the AUR seem to cause problems.
I recommend installing these packages with stack, [here's how.](https://brianbuccola.com/how-to-install-xmonad-and-xmobar-via-stack/)

On Gentoo Linux, compile xmobar with the `xpm` and `xft` USE flags.
